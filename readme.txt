Client Crisis (CliCri) offers a prebuilt Dark Site that temporarily disables the normal site, only showing what's most important for the public.

== Description ==

When an emergency suddenly strikes an organization, the website is usually the first place the public turns to for information. There is usually no time to construct a custom crisis site from scratch. Instead, a custom Dark Site can be instantaneously turned on when needed.

Client Crisis (CliCri) offers a prebuilt Dark Site that temporarily disables the normal site, only showing what's most important for the public. You can prepare content before publishing the Dark Site, and update content when needed. It only takes the click of a button to enter Crisis Mode. 

During an emergency, a Dark Site serves a number of key strategic purposes. It positions your organization to be the primary source of accurate information, and signals control and transparency. Running your website normally during times of crisis might indicate that your organization does not take the crisis seriously.
